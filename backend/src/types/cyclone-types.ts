This provides flexibility to include data not officially supported in the standard without having to use additional namespaces or create extensions. Unlike key-value stores, properties support duplicate names, each potentially having different values. Property names of interest to the general public are encouraged to be registered in the [CycloneDX Property Taxonomy](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy). Formal registration is OPTIONAL.
